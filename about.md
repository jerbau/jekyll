### Overview
The **TCEV Emergency** web project is a rift from another personal [project](https://app.simplenote.com/p/SPSlbJ) which started on September 9, 2020. Once complete, **TCEV Emergency** may be used as a resource to contact authorities in case of an emergency or for whichever purpose they see fit. Completely ad-free, the author hopes that someday it could help save a life.
